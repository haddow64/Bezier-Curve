Bezier-Curve
============
The application draws two Bèzier curves, joined in the form of a piecewise curve, which forms a single looping curve. 

The application displays the control points of the curve along with lines connecting the control points for illustration of how these affect the Bèzier curve. The user can edit each one of the control points using a dialogue box giving exact X, Y and Z values for each point on the curve. 

An OpenGL sphere follows the path of the curve and the user can choose to use a fixed camera that is attached to the sphere as it travels along the path of the curve.
